[[book-asciidoc-syntax-doc-index]]
=== Document index
This is the document starting point, it contains document *metadata* and includes other files, which usually represent chapters.
By convention we start our documents with the `00.index.adoc` file.

.Sample _00.index.adoc_ document
[source,asciidoc,indent=0]
----
    = Document-Title: Document-Subtitle
    Author(s)

    include::01.introduction.adoc[]                             <9>
    include::02.other-document.adoc[]
----
<1> Subfolder where the converters look for references images, here `img`
<2> Pointer to theme folder, to be used later to reference other files, e.g. _title-logo-image_
<3> Generate Table of Contents
<4> Table of Contents to contain 3 levels
<5> Language to be used when generating static labels, important for locale - see (7)
<6> Include settings common to all documents, to change them in single place, e.g. code formatting
<7> Include language specific labels - see `:lang:` in (5)
<8> Comment within Asciidoc contents
<9> Include a file, here it's _01.introduction.adoc_

NOTE: Document metadata are defined line-by-line, they cannot be separated by an empty line.
In the example above _metadata_ definition spans until including attributes (7), then other document content files are included.



[[book-asciidoc-syntax-doc-version]]
=== Updating document version
Generated documents contain the version (revision) number on the 1st page and on further page footers.
This is controlled by the `:revnumber:` variable defined in your index file (see the section above).

.Update revision number on document update
NOTE: Please remember to update the `:revnumber:` when applying changes to the document, keep it in sync with revision history.



[[book-asciidoc-syntax-doc-nest]]
=== Document nesting structure
Asciidoc documents are similar to XML in nature:

* there is root element - which represents the document itself
* then there are chapters, nested within the document
* then there may be subchapters, nested, ... - and so on

.Nesting blocks within the document
[source,asciidoc,indent=0]
----
    = Document title: Document subtitle             - Document level
    == Chapter AAA                                  - 1 Chapter AAA 
    === Subchapter 1                                - 1.1 Subchapter 1
    Chapter contents
    === Subchapter 2                                - 1.2 Subchapter 2
    ==== Subchapter E                               - 1.2.1 Subchapter E
    ===== Subchapter X                              - 1.2.1.1 Subchapter X
    ==== Subchapter S                               - 1.2.2 Subchapter S
    == Chapter BBB                                  - 2 Chapter BBB
    === Subchapter 1                                - 2.1 Subchapter 1
    === Subchapter 2                                - 2.2 Subchapter 2
    === Subchapter 3                                - 2.3 Subchapter 3
    == Chapter CCC                                  - 3 Chapter CCC
----

As the example above shows - each chapter starts with `==`. +
Each time you nest content deeper - you also add one '=' to it.




[[book-asciidoc-syntax-images]]
=== Images
Images may be referenced using the `image::filename[]` syntax.
Please note the square brackets at the end - they are obligatory. 
Image reference must start at the beginning of the line, it may be passed additional attributes in the brackets.
Image may also have optional caption, which must start with dot followed by immediate label.

.Images
[source,asciidoc,indent=0]
----
    image::my-image1.png[]                          <1>

    .Image label                                    <2>
    image::my-image2.png[pdfwidth=100%]             <3>
----
<1> Image referenced, it is resolved against the _img_ directory (the _:imagesdir:_ variable)
<2> Label of the second image, a dot followed by label (no space)
<3> Second image referenced, it will be scaled to fit 100% of its block width

.My image does not convert!
TIP: When you export an image out of Microsoft Word - e.g. a PNG file - it may save it as interlaced image.
What if _asciidoctor_ complains about it? +
Open the image in Microsoft Paint and just Save it. That's it! Now it is a standard PNG file ;)




[[book-asciidoc-syntax-cross-ref]]
=== Cross-references
It is worth noting that chapters may be assigned identifiers - unique within the document - 
and these may later be used as a reference from other part of the same document, may link to it.

References defined in double square bracket, identifiers cannot contain spaces.

When you want to use that reference later, you use the same identifier surrounded by double triangular bracket.

.Cross-rederences
[source,asciidoc,indent=0]
----
    [[some-chapter-id]]
    == Some chapter

    [[some-other-chapter-id]]
    == Some other chapter
    From this chapter we want to reference the <<some-chapter-id>> chapter.
    We may also override the name when referencing it - <<some-chapter-id, our own ref name>>.
----



[[book-asciidoc-syntax-links]]
=== Links
Two basic types of links are:

* external links - these are typed as full URLs and the caption followed in square brackets
* cross-references - identifiers within triangle brackets


.Links
[source,asciidoc,indent=0]
----
    Text with a https://google.com link                                 <.>
    Text with a https://google.com[Google] link                         <.>

    Text with a cross-reference to <<some-id>>                          <.>
    Text with a cross-reference to <<some-id, with custom label>>       <.>
----
<.> URL without label, the link will use the URL as label
<.> URL with custom label - here _Google_
<.> Cross-reference without custom label, it will use the referenced chapter label
<.> Cross-reference with custom label - here _with custom label_




[[book-asciidoc-syntax-labels]]
=== Labels
Several types of objects - e.g. images, tables, source code blocks - may be assigned labels. +
Labels are automatically numbered. +
Labels are defined as a _dot_ that must start at the beginning of the line, followed by the label text (no space after the dot).

.Labels
[source,asciidoc,indent=0]
----
    .Some label
    image::my-image.png[]

    .Some table label
    |===
    | Some table cell | Some other cell
    |===

    .Source code label for an SQL block
    [source,sql,indent=0]
    ----
    select firstName, lastName from someTable
    ----
----




[[book-asciidoc-syntax-tables]]
=== Tables

[TIP]
.Disable word-wrapping in your editor
======
Work with large tables may be tricky to work with, especially tables with many columns or wide content.
Therefore it is advised to turn off _word wrapping_ in your editor.

If you are using _Visual Studio Code_ - word wrapping may be toggled using:

* kbd:[Alt+Z]
* menu:View[Toggle Word Wrap]
======

Basic table syntax::
+

[source,asciidoc,indent=0]
----

    | Cell1.1     |   Cell1.2   | Cell1.3
    | Cell2.1     |   Cell2.2   | Cell2.3
    |===
----
--


Header row, column width applied with custom align::
+
--
[source,asciidoc,indent=0]
----
    [options="header", cols=">2,^2,5"]              <.>
    |===
    | Cell1.1     |   Cell1.2   | Cell1.3           <.>
    | Cell2.1     |   Cell2.2   | Cell2.3           <.>
    |===
----
<.> Table options defined. `header` means that the 1st row will be a header row (special formatting).
There are 3 cols each with some width (here 9 in total) - that defines column width proportions, here: `2/9`, `2/9`, `5/9`.
The 1st column will be right-aligned and the 2nd column will be centered
<.> The 1st row, it will be rendered as the header row (options="header")
<.> Normal content row
--


Colspan and rowspan::
+
--
TIP: Table rows do not have to be defined in a single row, in fact *columns may be spread across several rows*.
It is the `|` character that determines that a new cell starts.
And it is your responsibility to know where a next row starts - may be tricky when using colspan and rowspan.


[source,asciidoc,indent=0]

    |===
----
<.> The 1st cell is using colspan=2
<.> this cell is using rowspan=3

For more details visit https://mrhaki.blogspot.com/2014/12/awesome-asciidoctor-span-cell-over-rows.html[Awesome Asciidoctor: Span Cell over Rows and Columns].
You may find complex table examples in this repository, eg. in `docs/Formal-Documents/DOC-Migration-Baseline-Configuration-039741`
--


Formatting cell content::
Table cell may contain formatted content, including complex lists, images or even nested tables.
To do so, the cell with the content ust be marked with `a|` instead of standard '|'.

            * with multiple items
            ** sometimes nested
                            | Cell2.3 content       <.>

    | Cell3.1   | Cell3.2   | Cell3.3               <.>
    |===
----
<.> Cell 2.2 may contain styled content
<.> That content may span several lines, e.g. the unordered list
<.> Then the next cell appears, as shown above - it is ok to have it indented to ease visual representation for the future editor
<.> And the next row starts normally
--




[[book-asciidoc-syntax-source-code]]
=== Source code
Asciidoc supports source code formatters.
This document uses the `rouge` code formatter - see https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge/wiki/List-of-supported-languages-and-lexers[list of supported formats].

To format some source code block, please define a _source_ block and define which format to use, e.g. `sql`, `java`, `yml`, `console`, `text`, etc

[[book-asciidoc-syntax-page-flow]]
=== Controlling page flow
Page flow may be controlled with requests to:

* force a page break - use `<<<` marker at the beginning of a line, surrounded with empty lines
* change page orientation to `landscape` (e.g. when working with wide tables)
* return back to `portrait` page orientation

[source,asciidoc,indent=0]
----
    Some content

    <<<                                                         <.>

    == Chapter after a page break

    // Switch the page layout to landscape for wide tables
    [.landscape]                                                <.>
    <<<
 
    Some wide content, it will start on the next page, landscape layout.
    This switch is permanent and you need to ask it to go back to _portrait_ if needed


    // Switch back to portrait for further pages                <.>
    [.portrait]
    <<<

    Some further content, it will start on the next page
----
<.> Force page break
<.> Change page orientation to _landscape_. It must be followed by page break. The landscape will start on the next page
<.> Change back to portrait. The next page will be in portrait mode.




[[book-asciidoc-syntax-footnotes]]
=== Footnotes
You may use footnotes in your content by using `footnote:[Footnote text]`. 
It will render a numbered linked item next to the text and the footnote text below the block.

[source,asciidoc,indent=0]
----
    Some text. footnote:[Footnote text]                                         <.>
    Some other text. footnote:[`John` - this section needs production data]     <.>
----
<.> A footnote with _Footnote text_ label to be rendered at the bottom of the block
<.> Another footnote example, some styling applied




[[book-asciidoc-syntax-comments]]
=== Comments
You may add comments to your Asciidoc content.
Comments start with two slashes (`//`) - the text to the end of the line will then be ignored by the parser.



[[book-asciidoc-syntax-blocks]]
=== Blocks
Everything in Asciidoc is a block.
This is the most fundamental concept here.

[source,asciidoc,indent=0]
----
    Some text.
    And some othe text, but it is part of the same block.

    This is some other block, because there was an empty line to start a new block  <.>

    And a new block.

    Blocks are extremely useful to indent content within various list types, e.g.

    * some unordered item                                                           <.>
    +                                                                               <.>
    --                                                                              <.>
    And you want an image                                                           <.>
    image::image-name.png[]

    and a code block nested within the same list item

    [source,sql,indent=0]
    ----
    select x,y from z
    ----
    --                                                                              <.>

    * continue the list outside of the block                                        <.>
    ** deeper nest
----
<.> New block, since there was an empty line before it
<.> Start a list, and you want to have some content _nested within_ that block (indented)
<.> This `+` sign means that you want to continue the existing block with another one
<.> Declare a new block with double dash - `--`
<.> Put any content inside: text, images, other lists, admonitions, code blocks, ...
<.> Finish the lock with double dash - `--`
<.> Start another list, at the same level as the one on top




[[book-asciidoc-syntax-lists]]
Lists::
Lists may be numbered and un-numbered, they may also be nested.
It is important to know that lists imply a _block_ and a list MUST start with a blank line, otherwise they will not format correctly.

----
<.> This list will not render correctly, as there is no empty line at the start of a list. The parser will treat it normal text.

[[book-asciidoc-syntax-play-colors]]
=== Playing with colors
Sometimes you want to change color of some text or highlight it.
To do so, you need to use _roles_, as they are defined in the theme.

The standard roles defined are:

* line-through
* underline
* big
* small

=== Other formatting tips
Formatting tips that you may find handy:

* use ` +` (space +) at the end of a line to force line break. +
By default text within single block is continued in the same line, even if it resides in the next line.

* use `+` to connect two blocks (see the tip above). The '+' must be at the beginning of a line
* use `\kbd:[key]` to render a keyboard shortcut,e.g. `\kbd:[Alt+Z]` to render kbd:[Alt+Z]
* use `\menu:top-menu[menu1 > menu2]` to render a menu, +
e.g. `\menu:View[Toolbars > Font panel]` to render menu:View[Toolbars > Font panel]
